## What is this?
This is about humans thinking and writing. It functions offline. It works across different operating systems as long as JavaScript isn't restricted. In other words, I aimed to create something that as many people as possible can use comfortably.

This is a memo pad that I've distilled from feature-rich text editors down to only the functions I believe are necessary for writing. It's a tool for writing. It's also a tool for thinking while writing.

## Design Background & Philosophy

I didn't choose this color instead of deep indigo just because it's easier to concentrate. We need time to organize our thoughts in our own words, according to our own values, about future generations, the next generation of children, and the natural environment. Majestic mountains, beautiful lakes, and the mystical forests that embrace them all. I chose this color as a **symbol** of such a **sanctuary**. I hope you'll like it.

When I think back to August 2000, the internet itself was still new and had only some users. There were no social media or smartphones. Communication lines were slow, and there were text-centered websites. Compared to that time, I don't think humans have become proportionally happier as information has increased.

Haven't we seen an increase in people who can no longer imagine or simulate things that could be understood through thinking? The HTML file in this ZIP package is only about 10KB. Since 1024KB equals 1MB, you can see how extremely small this is. Thanks to the high performance of browsers, when you try to focus on essential functions, you can reduce things dramatically.

I kept the "Copy All" button for those who find keyboard shortcuts difficult to use due to disability or aging, and prefer mouse operations. I explicitly provided the "Clear All" function for user data sovereignty.

And by saving data to `localStorage`, I prevented the risk of losing documents in progress.

So I want you to use this tool when you want to think about something, when you want to put thoughts into words, or when you want to save paper resources by going paperless.

Ichigo Ichi-e has roots in Buddhism and represents Japanese aesthetics and culture that values each moment and each encounter. It resonates with the philosophies of Bushido, tea ceremony, and Zen. I believe that the words you're about to write also have their "moment" and "encounter." That's why I narrowed down the functions. I don't want to disturb your concentration.

I hope that this mere 10KB HTML file can provide you with quiet time and environment.

For these reasons, I recommend using a PC where JavaScript constraints are minimal.
